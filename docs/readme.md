# Arduino_HS300x Library

The Arduino_HS300x library allows you to use the [HS300x](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/dst/hs300x-datasheet) sensor available on the Arduino® Nano 33 BLE Sense R2 board, to read the temperature and the relative humidity of the environment.

To use this library:

```
#include <Arduino_HS300x.h>
```

Main features of the Arduino_HS300x sensor:

- Humidity accuracy: ±1.5% RH, 10 - 90% RH
- Humidity range: 0 to 100%.
- Temperature sensor accuracy: ±0.2°C
- Temperature range: -10 to +80°C
